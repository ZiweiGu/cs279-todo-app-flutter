# cs279-todo-app-flutter

An app built with Flutter and Dart. All the files in folder "todo_app" are automatically generated by running "flutter create todo_app" on command line. All the app functionality code I wrote is in file "main.dart" under folder "lib". I followed this [tutorial](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/build-a-todo-list-app-with-flutter/) to build the app. To run the app, make sure [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) is installed. Then, navigate to the todo_app directory:
```
cd todo_app
```

And then run:
```
flutter run
```

When asked which system to run on, choose "Chrome" to run a web app demo in Google Chrome. The app supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
